# Contribute to Thingy

## Welcome!

Thank you for wanting to contribute to Thingy! I appreciate your interest in helping me improve this project. This project is a bit unique in ... that it's very private, but everyone's contributions are welcome. I hope everyone can have their own "Thingy".
So, I would like you to choose a **fork** rather than a **pull** when you make changes ...
If you find a bug, just file an **issue**.

 that's all I have to say for the moment. Have fun.
